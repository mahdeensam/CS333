Extensions:
I undertook 8 extensions, each enhancing the project's capability in unique ways, and documented thoroughly in the accompanying project report. Here's a brief overview:

- Extension 1: Scala implementation of the word frequency counter.
- Extension 2: R script for word frequency analysis.
- Extension 3: Binary Search Tree in C for optimized word counting.
- Extension 4: Hash map implementation in C for efficient data retrieval.
- Extension 5: Advanced error handling in C to enhance program robustness.
- Extension 6: Creative JavaScript snippet featuring a poetic exploration of programming functions.
- Extension 7: Implementation of features to enhance the usability of the word frequency counter. 
- Extension 8: Python implementation using a Binary Search Tree to efficiently handle large text files.

Description for Each Subsection:
C Programming:
- Task 1 and 2
    - Files: LinkedList.c, LinkedList.h, task1.c
    - Description: Implements a word frequency counter using a linked list for data storage. Details of implementation can be found within the source files.
    - Output: Results are documented in the project report, demonstrating successful frequency counting.

JavaScript:
- Task 1
    - File: task1.js
    - Description: A JavaScript version of the word frequency counter. It processes text files to count word occurrences, normalizing text and handling punctuation.
    - Output: The program's output is included in the project report, showcasing top word frequencies.

Extensions and Additional Tasks:
- Found on Google Sites and detailed in the report. Each extension explores different programming concepts and data structures, enhancing the main project with additional functionality and robust error handling.
