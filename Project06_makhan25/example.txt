The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Why does the fox jump? 
Because the fox is quick and the dog is lazy! This is a simple example of 
a text file containing a variety of words, with punctuation to test the 
word counter's ability to strip punctuation and handle case insensitivity.

Consider the following words: apple, Apple, APPLE! They should all count 
as one word, "apple". Similarly, endings like dogs, dog's and dogs' should 
be counted by their root word "dog" if the program handles them properly.

Lastly, this text includes numbers and terms like co-op, re-enter, and non-stop 
to see how well the program handles hyphens and other special characters typically 
found in various texts.
