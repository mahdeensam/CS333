Description for Each Subsection:

Task 1:  
- Description: Implements a rotation cipher (ROT13) where the text changes accordingly when moved by 13 units.
  
Task 2:  
- Description: Counts the number of rows and characters, as well as the frequencies of each vowel in the document.
  
Task 3:  
- Description: Parses HTML-like text, extracting relevant elements such as page titles, headers, body text, and links.
  
Task 4:  
- Description: Parses a C-like language, identifying keywords, identifiers, parentheses, brackets, assignments, integers, floats, conditions, and operators.
